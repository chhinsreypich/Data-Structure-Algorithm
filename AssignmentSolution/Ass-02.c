        Practice Problems

    1. What are the elements of b after the call reverse(b + 1, lenb - 1),
    where b, reverse, and lenb are as in 09-rev.c? Is it wrong to call reverse(b + 1, lenb)?

    2. A student observes that most functions that process arrays are passed both an array and
    the array length, as in

        void g(int a[], size_t n)
        {
        // some code
        }

    However, the array length is known to the compiler, so that we may instead compute the
    array length in the body of the function, as in
        void g(int a[])
        {
        size_t n = sizeof(a) / sizeof(int);
        // some code
        }
    Is the student correct? Explain.

    3. What is size t, and what guarantees does the C standard make about it?

    4. In class, we mentioned that in almost all cases, the name of an array in an expression is
    converted to a pointer to the first element of the array. What are the exceptions to this
    rule?

    1. King: Chap. 11: Exercises: #8: Write a function, declared as below, which is passed an
    array of length n, and returns a pointer to the arrayâ€™s largest element.
    int *find_largest(int a[], size_t n);

    Use it in main as follows: define a test array (as in 07-ptr-maxmin.c) and, using find largest,
    increment the value of the largest element of the array. Finally, print all the elements of
    the array.
